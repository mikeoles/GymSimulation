1. Simulate Arrivals to the gym(input modeling)
2. Determine whether the member will use a bench or not(binomial distribution)
3. Add member to the wait queue (check if there's an open rack[for their exerciseType]) if there is: step 4.
4. Assign member to open rack. Calculate wait time.  
5. Simulate the lift time of the member(input modeling).
6. When lift time is up.  Remove member from rack.  If queue has members: step 4, 
if not increase the number of free racks.
